Read her story about them here: https://nyti.ms/2IVsbeV","We are one week away from the California primary. Franklin Graham, the son of the late evangelist Billy Graham, has been leading a bus tour up California ahead of the vote, urging evangelicals to vote their values and change what he sees as an increasingly heathen state. In Pasadena last week, he said that ""progressive"" was ""just another word for godless."" Elizabeth Dias, a New York Times correspondent, has been following the caravan across the state. Droves of conservative evangelicals have been showing up at Graham's rallies. Tonight Dias is at Graham's 6th rally, this time outside of Modesto. She'll be talking to evangelicals at the event. If you have questions or thoughts, leave them in the comments and Dias will bring you into the conversation.
