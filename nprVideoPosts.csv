"Some experiences stick with you. They cry out for reflection, for the transfigurative potential of an artistic response. That was the case for Mike Reed, the intrepid Chicago drummer and bandleader, after his harrowing encounter with white supremacists in 2009.

Reed was on tour in Eastern Europe with his flagship band, People, Places & Things. While passing through the Czech Republic by train, they were menaced by a group of neo-Nazis, narrowly escaping harm through the intervention of riot police. Later, mulling over these events, Reed decided to create a suite called Flesh & Bone. After its concert premiere at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2015, it was released as an album last year.

Jazz Night In America asked Reed to recount that instigating flare of racial tension, which hasn’t lost any of its relevance in the years since.

“I believe the greatest things that we can make [are] derived from our own experiences, or our ability to look at experiences.” - Mike Reed's Sights & Sounds, drummer and composer","Some experiences stick with you.

"“We’ve seen so many elder statesmen of jazz go on way past the point of really being able to play even halfway decently,” says vibraphonist Gary Burton, “and no one will tell them.”

For a long stretch of his early performing career, Burton was always the youngest man on the bandstand. He was all of 18 when he released his debut album. This spring Burton became something else altogether: a retiree. And, at 74, still in possession of his quicksilver fluidity and deep intuition, he went on a farewell tour, visiting a small handful of cities that mean something to Burton, playing material that fit the same criteria. @JazzNight caught up with the tour at Blues Alley in Washington D.C., at Birdland in New York City, and at the Jazz Kitchen in Indianapolis, the final stop on the tour.
